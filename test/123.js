Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles, that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.\n \n From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, the drink has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch liquor which originally had been a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy.\n \n Gin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured gin-based liqueurs such as, for example, Sloe gin, traditionally by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar."},{"id":238,"name":"Grand Marnier","image":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grand Marnier.png","image_s":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grand Marnier-Small.png","image_m":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grand Marnier-Medium.png","description":"Grand Marnier (French pronunciation: ​[ɡʁɑ̃ maʁnje]) Cordon Rouge is an orange-flavored liqueur created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is made from a blend of Cognac brandy, distilled essence of bitter orange, and sugar. Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge is 40% alcohol (70 Proof in UK, 80 Proof in US). Aside from Cordon Rouge, the Grand Marnier line includes other liqueurs, most of which can be consumed 'neat' as a cordial or a digestif, and can be used in mixed drinks and desserts. In France this kind of use is the most popular, especially with Crêpes Suzette and 'crêpes au Grand Marnier'. César Ritz (1850–1918) reportedly came up with the name 'Grand Marnier' for Marnier-Lapostolle, who in return helped him purchase and establish the Hotel Ritz Paris. On March 15, 2016, the Campari Group announced the launch of a friendly takeover offer for Société des Produits Marnier Lapostolle S.A., owner of Grand Marnier."},{"id":293,"name":"Lemon Juice","image":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Lemon Juice.png","image_s":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Lemon Juice-Small.png","image_m":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Lemon Juice-Medium.png","description":"null"},{"id":250,"name":"Grenadine","image":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grenadine.png","image_s":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grenadine-Small.png","image_m":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Grenadine-Medium.png","description":"Grenadine is a commonly used, non-alcoholic bar syrup, characterized by a flavour that is both tart and sweet, and by a deep red colour. It is popular as an ingredient in cocktails, both for its flavour and to give a reddish/pink tint to mixed drinks.\n \n The name grenadine originated from the French word grenade which means pomegranate, with pomme meaning apple and granate derived from the Italian word for seeds.\n \n Grenadine was originally prepared from pomegranate juice, sugar, and water.\n \n As grenadine is subject to minimal regulation, its basic flavour profile can alternatively be obtained from a mixture of blackcurrant juice and other fruit juices with the blackcurrant flavour dominating.\n \n To reduce production costs, manufacturers have widely replaced fruit bases with artificial ingredients. The Mott's brand 'Rose's' is by far the most common brand of grenadine sold in the United States,[3] and is formulated from (in order of concentration): high fructose corn syrup, water, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, FD\u0026C Red #40, natural and artificial flavours and FD\u0026C Blue #1. In Europe, Bols still manufactures grenadine with pomegranate."},{"id":18,"name":"Amaretto","image":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Amaretto.png","image_s":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Amaretto-Small.png","image_m":"www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/Amaretto-Medium.png","description":"Amaretto (Italian for 'a little bitter') is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy. Various commercial brands are made from a base of apricot pits, almonds, or both.\n \n When served as a beverage, amaretto can be drunk by itself, used as an ingredient to create several popular mixed drinks, or added to coffee. Amaretto is also commonly used in culinary applications.\n \n The name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning 'bitter', which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness of amaretto tends to be mild, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products. Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as 'a little bitter'. Cyanide is processed out of the almond preparation prior to its use.\n \n Conflation of amaro ('bitter') and amore ('love') has led to associations with romance.\n \n One should not confuse amaretto with amaro, a different family of Italian liqueurs that, while also sweetened, have a stronger bitter flavour derived from herbs."}]
